# GLUCare: Advanced Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring System using NIR Spectroscopy

## Overview
GLUCare is an innovative project aimed at developing a non-invasive glucose monitoring system using Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy. This device provides a painless alternative to traditional finger-pricking methods for diabetics and non-diabetics, enabling continuous and real-time blood glucose monitoring.
