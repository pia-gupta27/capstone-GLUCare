1. **Data Acquisition**: The NIR sensor measures glucose levels non-invasively by analyzing light absorption in the skin.
2. **Data Processing**: The Arduino processes the sensor's raw data, converting it into readable glucose values.
3. **Data Display & Transmission**: Results are shown on the LCD and transmitted to the website for remote access.
4. **Web Access**: Users log in to a secure website to monitor glucose levels, track trends, and receive notifications.

## Outcomes
- To develop an accurate and reliable non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device.
- Validate the proposed system using current testing methods across different demographies. 
- Develop a user-friendly web application which will track user's blood glucose level.
